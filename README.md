The game application is a two player game where the players enter their names first and then start the game. 
The game is about rolling a die where the first player clicks a roll dice button and a random number between one and six is generated,
the more you click the more numbers are added up to your turn score. if you roll a one, the game goes to the second player and you don't
get any points. The hold button adds up your turn score and they get displayed as total score. The first one to get a hundred points
wins the game.
